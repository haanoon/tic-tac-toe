Question 1
To check if a variable is equal to some number, which conditional operator do we use:

1 / 1 point

<


==


>


=

Correct
Correct. We use 2 equal symbols to compare two things, as for 1 equal sign is used to assign a value to a variable.

2.
Question 2
If we have two variables X and Y, and we wanted to create an if statement that checks if X is equal to 1 and Y is equal to 2 and both statements need to be true to execute some code, we do:

1 / 1 point

if(X == 1 && Y == 2)


if(X == 1 & Y == 2)


if(X == 1 || Y == 2)

Correct
Correct. && is used to check whether 2 statements or more are correct or not, and if at least one of them is false, then the entire condition is false.

3.
Question 3
A Data Type that only takes two values whether 0(False) or 1(True) is called:

1 / 1 point

int


bool


char

Correct
Correct. bool is short for Boolean which accepts only two values.

4.
Question 4
Which of the following increments the variable X by 1 (select all that apply):

0.75 / 1 point

X + 1


X = X + 1

Correct
Correct. This takes the value of X and adds 1 to it.


X += 1;


X++;

Correct
Correct. This takes the value of X and adds 1 to it.

Question 5
If we wanted the loop to execute at least once even if the condition will never be true, we use:

1 / 1 point

For loop


While loop


Do While loop

Correct
Correct. The Do While loop will always execute the body of the loop first then check the condition second.

6.
Question 6
To stop the loop from going, even when the condition is true, we use:

1 / 1 point

stop;


continue;


break;

Correct
Correct. The Break statement forces the loop to stop.

7.
Question 7
The first element of any is at index 0:

1 / 1 point

True


False

Correct
Correct. In C++ the first element of the array will always be at index 0.

8.
Question 8
A Two-dimensional Array is an array of arrays:

1 / 1 point

True


False

Correct
Correct. Each element of a Two-dimensional array is itself an array.

9.
Question 9
To clear the console screen we use:

1 / 1 point

system(“cls”);


clear;


restart;

Correct
Correct. This command clears the entire console screen, cls is short for "clear screen"
